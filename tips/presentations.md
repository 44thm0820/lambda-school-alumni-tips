# Presentations:

- “Do at least one brown bag presentation [while in Lambda School].” - William Pelton

- "The best talks all have these things in common: Speaking is organized to sync with but not regurgitate visual materials, the talk goes in-depth about a specific thing (JSON Web Tokens, MongoDB Atlas, Resumes, Building a portfolio page with Gatsby, Testing Node applications with Jest, etc.), and it's tailored to the Lambda audience (i.e. people who know what a function is but might not know the time complexity of a nested for-loop)" - William Pelton
