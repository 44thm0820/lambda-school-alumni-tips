# Personal Website or Portfolio:

- “Start your portfolio page from something like the second week after you learn HTML and CSS and then continue to update and add new features as you learn new things.” - Christopher Atoki

- “Pick either `.com` or `.io` [for your domain name]. I probably wouldn’t use `.net`. I would even use `.code` before `.net`.” - Christopher Atoki

- “Buy a good domain name and host it if you can afford it. I got grantreighard.com.” - Grant Reighard

- “Always go for the `.com` [domain name] for the most authority. You could alternately buy several and redirect one to the other.” - Grant Reighard
