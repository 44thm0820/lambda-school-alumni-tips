# Studying:

- “Definitely take notes. Remember that there is almost never one way of doing things. So a good task is that, when you learn how to do something, always try to find other ways to do it. And another thing is start your portfolio page from something like the second week after you learn HTML and CSS and then continue to update and add new features as you learn new things.” - Christopher Atoki

- “Practice, practice. Each and every day, keep coding even if you have the day off for at least an hour. You don’t want to get rusty, but do NOT burn yourself out. It is so important to take breaks.” - Rachel DiCesare

- “Make sure you do pair programming because it could do you wonders, especially when you enter the CS portion [of the program]. The PMs try to get people in their groups paired up together, but most of the time people have to seek that out on their own.” - Rachel DiCesare

- “I'd really recommend making sure you choose a favorite stack and really take ownership over it. So if you start finding you really like React with Python/Django, then start building full stack functioning apps over and over again. Learn how to build a full backend and frontend and choose one way to do it and learn it to the point of full ownership over that stack. Go is great for backend! Vue is great for front! None of that really matters tho.. What you'll get from this advice is such a great birds eye view of how it has to work regardless of language, and get used to making API calls to a DB, you'll find yourself very well equipped to switch to any other tech stack you're asked to.” - Austin Howes

- “Pay attention to data structures. It’s always surprising when and how those come up, and you’ll be grateful to know them! - Austin Howes

- “If you're comfortable with HTML and CSS, try and get as solid of a foundation as you can get in Javascript. Some of the more advanced JS topics gave a good number of students from my cohort a tough time. Plus, React is built on those topics so getting a solid JS understanding can pave the way through the front end section. Personally, I went through all but the last few algorithm sections for JS on FreeCodeCamp. Then there is a YouTube channel called Traversy Media, and he has a tutorial working with the DOM. That tutorial got me really prepared for the DOM sections at Lambda.” - Bernard Johnson

- “Just utilize all of the resources and spend the extra time doing code challenges outside of the daily one.” - Kyle Kauzlarich

- “At any level of coding, there are no dumb questions no matter how dumb the question might actually seem. If you don't know the answer and you've searched for the answer yourself, then please ask those who are more experienced. Ask your fellow buddies or PMs to fill in the blanks asap. It's better to leave no stones unturned rather than finding out later in your study that you should've figured it out beforehand.” - Henry Kim

- “Coding 9-5 daily is grueling. Some people really enjoy it. But for myself personally, I was starting to burn out about 4 months in. The more I learned, the more I realized I'm not great at coding, and my self-confidence tanked quite a bit in the process. If you do find yourself in the same situation, don't worry. Coding has a such demanding learning curve (more so when you get into more complex stuff later on), so don't lose heart. A lot of people (if not most) went through similar experiences in my cohort.” - Henry Kim

- “Do a lot of practice, and perhaps find a few people to work on pair programming with. I got a crew of 5 that I kept in touch with afterwards. Nothing like it.” - Jason Nuhn

- “This is the most a human being can learn in a six month period. It will feel like failing if you're doing it right. Labs may be the first time you will feel genuinely competent at this.” - William Pelton

- “Reaching out to TAs and instructors is how you get the full benefit of your education. You will be paying these people 17% of your gross income for two years, so don't be shy.” - William Pelton

- “Do literally everything the instructors and staff tell you, from the algorithm exercises to the resume formatting.” - William Pelton

- “People learning right next to you are a great resource, but also just as likely not to know the answer as you. The docs are a fast, reliable way to get the right answer.” - William Pelton

- “Be prepared for the next day by watching the precourse videos the night before (I believe this is the new standard they're going for anyway). Work on personal projects on the side and over weekends. Refine projects you work on during class so you can show them off to future employers.” - Grant Reighard
