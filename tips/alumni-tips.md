### Asking Questions

- “At any level of coding, there are no dumb questions no matter how dumb the question might actually seem. If you don't know the answer and you've searched for the answer yourself, then please ask those who are more experienced. Ask your fellow buddies or PMs to fill in the blanks asap. It's better to leave no stones unturned rather than finding out later in your study that you should've figured it out beforehand.” - Henry Kim

* “Reaching out to TAs and instructors is how you get the full benefit of your education. You will be paying these people 17% of your gross income for two years, so don't be shy.” - William Pelton

* “People learning right next to you are a great resource, but also just as likely not to know the answer as you. The docs are a fast, reliable way to get the right answer.” - William Pelton

### Blogging Tips

- “It would be great if you could blog every week about your experiences at Lambda. I just read a PM’s blog, and I wish I had done that.” - Grant Reighard

- “Medium is the go-to blogging service for tech stuff in my opinion. There’s also creating a WordPress blog on your own domain if you buy that (plus hosting).” - Grant Reighard

### Capstone Project

- "For Capstone Projects, it's a test to see if you can learn how to adapt to a new language, platforms, libaries etc. to solve problems as simply as possible. Most importantly, it's also about how you communicate with others to further the progress of the project. Personally, I think it's really important to have good and informed opinions on features or ways to tackle problems. Your project (and product) is the ultimate goal, so know when to support your argument or when to back down on an idea." - Henry Kim

### Focused Topics of Study

- “I'd really recommend making sure you choose a favorite stack and really take ownership over it. So if you start finding you really like React with Python/Django, then start building full stack functioning apps over and over again. Learn how to build a full backend and frontend and choose one way to do it and learn it to the point of full ownership over that stack. Go is great for backend! Vue is great for front! None of that really matters tho.. What you'll get from this advice is such a great birds eye view of how it has to work regardless of language, and get used to making API calls to a DB, you'll find yourself very well equipped to switch to any other tech stack you're asked to.” - Austin Howes

- “Pay attention to data structures. It’s always surprising when and how those come up, and you’ll be grateful to know them! - Austin Howes

* “If you're comfortable with HTML and CSS, try and get as solid of a foundation as you can get in Javascript. Some of the more advanced JS topics gave a good number of students from my cohort a tough time. Plus, React is built on those topics so getting a solid JS understanding can pave the way through the front end section. Personally, I went through all but the last few algorithm sections for JS on FreeCodeCamp. Then there is a YouTube channel called Traversy Media, and he has a tutorial working with the DOM. That tutorial got me really prepared for the DOM sections at Lambda.” - Bernard Johnson

### General Advice

- “Do literally everything the instructors and staff tell you, from the algorithm exercises to the resume formatting.” - William Pelton

* “Be prepared for the next day by watching the precourse videos the night before (I believe this is the new standard they're going for anyway). Work on personal projects on the side and over weekends. Refine projects you work on during class so you can show them off to future employers.” - Grant Reighard

### Job Search

- “Lambda will have your back every step of the way. Try to stand out as someone who will evangelize for the school and look out for other students and they're going to want to make sure their name is stamped to you in a good job somewhere. Basically, they take care of their own, so try and make sure you brand yourself as a team player, if that makes sense.” - Austin Howes

- “Always network. People always want to hire from within. Anyone can learn to code, so if they like you as a culture fit and you are confident and passionate about being there, then you're 90% of the way to the finish line. “ - Austin Howes

- “Start networking and building side projects yesterday. This will fast-track finding a job.” - Justin Kaseman

- "Start your portfolio page from something like the second week after you learn HTML and CSS and then continue to update and add new features as you learn new things.” - Christopher Atoki

- "Just practice your coding by creating small projects yourself and/or recompiling your old codes to be more efficient/shorter. Do a daily run of whiteboard questions (if you're in that stage already).... And frankly, Reddit is your friend for resources/practice routines." - Henry Kim

### Pair Programming

- “Make sure you do pair programming because it could do you wonders, especially when you enter the CS portion [of the program]. The PMs try to get people in their groups paired up together, but most of the time people have to seek that out on their own.” - Rachel DiCesare

* “Do a lot of practice, and perhaps find a few people to work on pair programming with. I got a crew of 5 that I kept in touch with afterwards. Nothing like it.” - Jason Nuhn

### Personal Website or Portfolio

- “Start your portfolio page from something like the second week after you learn HTML and CSS and then continue to update and add new features as you learn new things.” - Christopher Atoki

- “Pick either `.com` or `.io` [for your domain name]. I probably wouldn’t use `.net`. I would even use `.code` before `.net`.” - Christopher Atoki

- “Buy a good domain name and host it if you can afford it. I got grantreighard.com.” - Grant Reighard

- “Always go for the `.com` [domain name] for the most authority. You could alternately buy several and redirect one to the other.” - Grant Reighard

### Practice

- “Practice, practice. Each and every day, keep coding even if you have the day off for at least an hour. You don’t want to get rusty, but do NOT burn yourself out. It is so important to take breaks.” - Rachel DiCesare

* “Don't copy and paste. I know they push this more now, but seriously type every line of code out and then rewrite it. That helps it stick in your memory.” - Justin Kaseman

* "Constantly writing something and struggling to figure things out is the best way to go. For example, you might struggle on a problem for 8+ hours (I certainly did) when you are starting to grind whiteboard questions, but as you get better at recognizing the patterns, the time it takes to think and write will become smaller by steps. Improvements are never linear. It was always big or small incremental improvement after days or even weeks for me." - Henry Kim

### Presentations

- “Do at least one brown bag presentation [while in Lambda School].” - William Pelton

- "The best talks all have these things in common: Speaking is organized to sync with but not regurgitate visual materials, the talk goes in-depth about a specific thing (JSON Web Tokens, MongoDB Atlas, Resumes, Building a portfolio page with Gatsby, Testing Node applications with Jest, etc.), and it's tailored to the Lambda audience (i.e. people who know what a function is but might not know the time complexity of a nested for-loop)" - William Pelton

### Self-Assigned Studying

- “Go beyond what the curriculum is. Don't bank on Lambda to be the end all. It is just scratching the surface. Stay curious and look up anything you hear that you don't know.” - Justin Kaseman

* “Spend the extra time doing code challenges outside of the daily one.” - Kyle Kauzlarich

### Self Care

- "Be sure to take many breaks, eat healthy meals, and get yourself out of the house as much as possible. Don’t stay up so late coding, and always get a good nights rest. I always try to do 10-15 minute breaks. I usually eat and drink something and take a step outside to go for a walk." - Rachel DiCesare

- “Keeping a life balance to avoid burnout is important. Eat healthily, drink water, exercise, meditate, and take breaks.” - Justin Kaseman

- “Keep the fire alive no matter how weakly or strongly it burns.” - Henry Kim

- “Take more breaks. Use a pomodoro app. Sleep as much as you need. Go exercise. Eat right. Shower.” - William Pelton

### Self-Doubt

- “Coding 9-5 daily is grueling. Some people really enjoy it. But for myself personally, I was starting to burn out about 4 months in. The more I learned, the more I realized I'm not great at coding, and my self-confidence tanked quite a bit in the process. If you do find yourself in the same situation, don't worry. Coding has a such demanding learning curve (more so when you get into more complex stuff later on), so don't lose heart. A lot of people (if not most) went through similar experiences in my cohort.” - Henry Kim

* “This is the most a human being can learn in a six month period. It will feel like failing if you're doing it right. Labs may be the first time you will feel genuinely competent at this.” - William Pelton

### Taking Notes

- “Definitely take notes. Remember that there is almost never one way of doing things. So a good task is that, when you learn how to do something, always try to find other ways to do it." - Christopher Atoki
