# Captstone Project:

- "For Capstone Projects, it's a test to see if you can learn how to adapt to a new language, platforms, libaries etc. to solve problems as simply as possible. Most importantly, it's also about how you communicate with others to further the progress of the project. Personally, I think it's really important to have good and informed opinions on features or ways to tackle problems. Your project (and product) is the ultimate goal, so know when to support your argument or when to back down on an idea." - Henry Kim
