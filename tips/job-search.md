- “Always network. People always want to hire from within. Anyone can learn to code, so if they like you as a culture fit and you are confident and passionate about being there, then you're 90% of the way to the finish line. “ - Austin Howes

Try to stand out as someone who will evangelize for the school and look out for other students and they're going to want to make sure their name is stamped to you in a good job somewhere. Basically, they take care of their own, so try and make sure you brand yourself as a team player, if that makes sense.” - Austin Howes
